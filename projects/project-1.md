As Covid-19 could potentially stay on surfaces for about 2-3 days and grocery stores need their workers to constantly clean their products and the whole store, which would cost a lot plus an increase of labor cost. While there are Ultraviolet Disinfecting or (UVD) robots that Hospitals use to disinfect, they cost around $80-$90,000 each. My objective was to build a low-cost, easily replicable robot prototype that is programmed to spray disinfectant solutions in different directions, called the Sanibot. The Sanibot goes around the area of its scope that sprays a safe 70% isopropyl alcohol that could potentially prevent the spread of the Coronavirus on small establishments such as grocery stores or other high contact areas.
