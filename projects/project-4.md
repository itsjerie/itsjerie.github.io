# Overview

Not many students know about all of our fine dish eateries on the UH Manoa campus. In addition, some students who want to try new restaurants may not get a chance to because they may have time conflicts with their schedule leaving some restaurants having either too many students in line or not enough students.

Thus, Manoa Eats was created ✨

Manoa Eats is a web application that will allow students and staff access to the different eateries information on campus. 

This website aims to give access to hardworking students to nourish their brains with UH’s nutritious food located all around the campus. Students will be able to upload their schedules along with their course locations, and our website will estimate the best restaurant locations to stop at on their path to their next class.

# Manoa Eats Staff

Manoa Eats is designed, implemented, and maintained by Tyler Baguio, Kristi Chinen, Jeraldine Milla, Nenye Ndili, and Gavin Peng.

As the project manager, I helped the team get our tasks organized and kept our team on track with the deadlines. This task challenged my organization skills and my leadership skills. Giving my memebers a safe space to be open with their ideas and opinions and help moderate discussion, is one of the tasks that I had to work on for this team.

# Reflection

\This research project was under Dr. Aaron Ohta's [Microdevices & Microfluidics Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/uh-mnm-lab/members) for the Native Hawaiian Science & Engineering Mentorship Program ([NHSEMP](https://sites.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/nhsemp/home?authuser=0)) [Hawaii PEEC II: Manoa Design Clinic](https://sites.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/nhsemp/what-we-do/summer-programs/m%C4%81noa-design-clinic?authuser=0).

As the Computer Engineering major in the team, I was in charge of preparing the dataset, training the network, and analyzing the data for both embryones and droplet datasets. I mostly worked with MATLAB to prepare my dataset which requires me to trace out each embryo/droplet from a frame in a video, which usually requires 1000+ frames to be used in training the network.

This project was my first research project which allows me to team up with other students from different disciplines to collaborate our ideas from our perspectives. It was quite challenging working through Zoom, but it worked out well as we also had proper guidance from our TA and advisor.
