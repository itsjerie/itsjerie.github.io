# Man O’ Munchies

*In collaboration with Gavin Peng, Tyler Baguio, Hyuma Tsuchiya, Jeraldine Milla*

## Overview

### The Problem
Not many students know about all of our fine dish eateries on the UH Manoa campus. In addition, some students who want to try new restaurants may not get a chance to because they may have time conflicts with their schedule leaving some restaurants having either too many students in line. 

### The Solution
Man O’ Munchies will allow hardworking students to nourish their brains with UH’s nutritious food located all around the campus. Students will be able to upload their schedules along with their course locations, and our website will estimate the best restaurant locations to stop at on their path to their next class.  

## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
- Landing Page
- User Home Page
- Admin Home Page
- User Profile Page
- Interactive Food map Page
- Restaurant’s Page 

## Use Case Ideas
- New user go to the landing page, signsup, gets home page, creates profile as user (uploads schedule, user details and course locations)
- New restaurant vendor goes to the landing page, signsup, gets home page, creates profile as user (put restaurant’s schedule, and menu items)
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, go to home page, edits the all pages and monitors accounts
- Visitors go to landing page and scroll through vendors and public posts

## Beyond The Basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
- Support local businesses on campus
- Help students time management 
- Prevent crowding or areas because of COVID and shorten wait times
