Since it's 2022, it's going to be a fresh start for me. This means I will start a new lifestyle, new mindset, and will try to learn new things. It will be challenging but I think I can do it, I just need the right motivation, just like for my ICS314 class which I have mixed feelings about. It is a class that will help in developing my programming skills as a software engineer, which will also teach me new skills not only in programming but also in life! For this Spring semester, I am looking forward to learning new programming languages and getting more programming experiences through class activities which I definitely think is going to be tough but I think it will be fun! (I hope)

## Learning JavaScript

Since we are in our first two weeks of this Spring semester, we started working on activities that involve programming in JavaScript. JavaScript is an interesting language that is more versatile compared to the other languages that I have encountered so far, such as C, C++, Python, and Java. There are similarities in the structures but there are also distinct differences in programming in JavaScript. It’s interesting to use ‘let’ and ‘const’ to declare a variable of an integer, string, or array instead of ‘int’ or ‘char’. Overall, I think that JavaScript is not a bad programming language, however, I think, as a student that has been programming in C++ and Python for my rover team, it is a bit weird and makes the programmer do easier programming.

## Changing habits

For this semester, we are encouraged to practice athletic software engineering, which I think makes sense and is already gradually helping me improve my working habits. However, I will be honest that I am already struggling with it for the first 2 weeks of this semester. I am still struggling in changing my study habits but since I am not the only one trying this new style of learning, it does give me some push to just do it. The practice workout of the day, aka WODs, that we have weekly is also very helpful in understanding since it helps us practice what we just learned within through the modules we read. Though I do find time-pressured activities very stressful and it makes my anxiety for this class worse, I understand the purpose of it and hope that I will get used to it since we are doing this every week.
