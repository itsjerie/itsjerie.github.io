# From Classroom to Career: Developing Skills and Leading Projects

As I approach the end of my college journey, I find myself in the last stretch of my academic career. In this final semester, I have enrolled in one of the last two classes I will have to take. This course has been a great experience for me, and I would like to share my thoughts on it.

The class I took was centered around creating a web app directory of the ICS department called [Room Directory](https://room-directory.github.io/). This directory was meant to include information about the faculty, offices, and clubs within the department. The project was quite challenging, as it required us to use a range of skills, including UI development, front-end development, and project management.

One of the things I enjoyed about this course was the opportunity to enhance my UI development and front-end skills. Before taking this class, I had some knowledge of these skills, but I was not confident in applying them to real-world projects. However, working on this project with my team members allowed me to put these skills into practice and gain the confidence I needed to take on more challenging projects.

Another valuable skill I developed in this class was project management. I learned how to organize my work, set realistic deadlines, and coordinate effectively with my team members. This experience was particularly helpful as it gave me a better understanding of what it takes to manage a project successfully.

Working with my team of nine members was also a great learning experience. I learned how to communicate effectively with others, how to work collaboratively, and how to be a team player. These are all valuable skills that I believe will be essential in any future job or project that I undertake.

As I look back on this class, I feel proud of the work we accomplished. More importantly, I feel grateful for the opportunity to develop these valuable skills. I believe that the skills I have developed and practiced in this class will be of great benefit to me in the future. Whether it's building a web app or working on a project with a team, I now have the confidence and experience to succeed.

In conclusion, I feel that this class has been a significant milestone in my college journey. It has allowed me to enhance my skills, develop new ones, and work effectively with others. With these skills development and practice, I hope to continue to develop my abilities and utilize them in my future work after college.
